** Python Inner Workings**
When you run any Python code, it gets converted into Bytecode, and this Bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

When you install Python, both the Bytecode compiler and the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) are installed automatically.

Compiled to Bytecode
Bytecode is a low-level set of instructions.
It is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any operating system.
Bytecode runs faster than plain source code.
Python files compiled to Bytecode usually have the .pyc or .pye extension.

__pycache__ Folder
This folder stores compiled Bytecode of Python files.
It is created when you import a Python module, not when you run a script directly.
For example: hello_chai.cpython-312.pye
cpython refers to the default implementation of Python.
312 means the Python version is 3.12.

Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
The PVM contains a loop that reads and executes Bytecode instructions one by one.
It works as the runtime engine of Python.
The PVM is also called the Python interpreter.


Important Notes
Bytecode is not machine code; it's an intermediate representation that only Python understands.
Bytecode is specifically interpreted by Python, not directly executed by the hardware.
